Research
--------

### Smart Phone Application for Fault Recognition

**Guide:**[Dr. Nishchal K. Verma](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~nishchal/)

R&D Project, IIT Kanpur (Summer 2012)

\

We developed a Smart Phone application, to learn different fault states
of an industrial air compressor. The application was tested to recognize
the fault state in real time as the air compressor was running. It has
performed very well with classification accuracies above 93.73%. It is
believed that similar application and model with some minor changes in
specifications can be used for acoustic pattern recognition in wide
range of fields; even in industry.

The paper *Smart Phone Application for Fault Recognition* has been
accepted for [ICST 2012](http://seat.massey.ac.nz/conferences/icst2012/)

Projects
--------

### Human vs. Computer Ping Pong Game in Python

**Guide:**[Prof. Piyush P. Kurur](http://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/ppk/)

Course Project, ESC 101A

\

Implemented a GUI game for[ping
pong](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Table_tennis) with a rudimentary AI
strategy. The game utilized the
[pygame](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pygame) module to implement the
interface.
